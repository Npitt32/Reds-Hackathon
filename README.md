# Reds-Hackathon

My code for the 2024 Reds Hackathon competition where my group members, Nathan Backman, Jake Balek, Hunter Geise, Danielle Napierski, and I were tasked with categorizing pitchers into different roles based on tendencies and pitching roles. For a more in-depth look into our project and the ability to see the fantastic work of my group mates, please visit either https://github.com/jakebalek25/2024-Reds-Hackathon (Jake's) or https://github.com/natekbackman/PitcherArchetypes (Nathan's)
